  # by setting an environment variable of the following form:
  #
  # CONJUR_FEATURE_<feature_name>_ENABLED=true
  #
  # <feature_name> must match the flag provide in the `feature_flags` arguement.
  #
  # The feature flag is available for using the following form:
  #
  # Rails.configuration.feature_flags.enabled?(:feature_name)

  # the status if no flag is given (its default state).
  # ex. { telemetry: true }
