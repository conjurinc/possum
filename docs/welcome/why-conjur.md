{% include toc.md key='complete' %}

Conjur provides a complete solution to secrets management for DevOps. It’s not just a tool that you have to figure out how to deploy and operationalize. Conjur comes with everything you need from basic setup instructions, pre-built and officially maintained integrations with the other DevOps software in your toolchain, to HA instructions and strategies that are easy to operationalize.

With Conjur, you can solve your secrets management problem quickly and easily.

{% include toc.md key='proven' %}

Conjur has been running in production in high-traffic customer environments for a number of years, solving real-world problems at companies like Cisco, Box, Puppet Labs, Discovery Communications, Ability Networks, Lookout, and Machine Zone.

In addition, Conjur’s cryptography has been professionally audited and verified, and the Conjur server is regularly and automatically penetration-tested.

{% include toc.md key='simple' %}

You can define your entire infrastructure using only 9 elements: policy, user, group, host, layer, variable, web service, role grant, and permission grant. And with just 5 REST functions you can authenticate, search, fetch secrets, perform permission checks, and fetch public keys.
Policies are defined using YAML, which is easy for both people and machines to read and understand.

{% include toc.md key='powerful' %}

Conjur provides full role-based access control, which is a proven model for infrastructure security. Unlike attribute-based access control, role-based access control is not susceptible to unexpected side-effects, and it scales very well to large systems through the use of role delegation.

{% include toc.md key='programmable' %}

Conjur is easily programmable by interacting with the REST API (documentation coming soon). This capability can be used to provide custom authentication and authorization for popular DevOps tools.
