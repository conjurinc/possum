# Installation

Installing Conjur is easy on any platform.

## Using the Conjur evaluation service

The evaluation service is the quickest way to get started using Conjur, giving
you immediate access to a running server. However, the evaluation service is
**for developers only** and you should never use it to store production secrets.

[Create an evaluation account](/try_conjur.html) and follow the instructions to
connect.

## Using your own Conjur server

Running your own Conjur server gives you total control over the software and
doesn't require you to connect to the Internet. Learn [how to install
self-hosted Conjur](/installation/self-host.html)
