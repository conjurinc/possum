A Conjur Community Edition server is running in the cloud for you, so you do not need to install a server to evaluate its features.
Your account login details for the cloud server were emailed to you at the start of the evaluation period.

In the near future, the Conjur server will be available for download and running on-premise. Please contact support with questions, or for assistance with the cloud server.
