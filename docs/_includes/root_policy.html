## Understand the root policy

The Conjur server starts up with a *root policy*, which defines a few basic objects that the rest of the system will be built on top of. The root policy used in this demo is simple. First it defines a group called `security_admin`, which is a group that will be able to administer the rest of the system. Then it defines a policy called `people`, which will define the human users and groups. And it defines a policy called `prod`, which will be populated with the production applications and services.

{% highlight yaml %}
# root.yml

- !group security_admin

- !policy
  id: people
  owner: !group security_admin

- !policy
  id: prod
  owner: !group security_admin
{% endhighlight %}

You can use the `conjur` command line tool to list all the objects in the system:

{% highlight shell %}
$ conjur list
Id                            Owner
----------------------------  ----------------------------
demo:policy:root           demo:user:admin
demo:group:security_admin  demo:user:admin
demo:policy:people         demo:group:security_admin
demo:policy:prod           demo:group:security_admin
{% endhighlight %}
