The [Kubernetes Demo](https://github.com/conjurdemos/scalability-k8s) is a set
of shell scripts that walks you through the steps for setting up a local Conjur
cluster in Kubernetes. The cluster is configured to perform automated secret
retrieval in a loop every few seconds and includes several scripts that can be
run to see how it responds to various interruptions, such as changing secret
values, access denial, and machine failovers.

See the [Kubernetes Demo GitHub repo](https://github.com/conjurdemos/scalability-k8s) for instructions on how to run the demo.
