The [Conjur Go API](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-api-go) provides a robust
programmatic interface to Conjur for your Go project. You can use the Go API to
authenticate with Conjur, load policies, fetch secrets, and more. Integration
with Conjur provides a variety of additional benefits including being able to
store security policy as code, and automated secret rotation.
