The [Conjur Puppet Module](https://forge.puppet.com/conjur/conjur) simplifies
the operations of establishing Conjur host identity and allows authorized Puppet
nodes to fetch secrets from Conjur. Integration with Conjur provides a number of
additional benefits, including security policy as code, and
automatic secret rotation.
