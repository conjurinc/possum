The [Chef Demo](https://github.com/conjur/chef-demo) is a set of scripts that
demonstrates how Conjur supports secure, automated assignment of identities on
a managed host that can securely fetch secrets. It will walk you through setting
up a simple chef deployment with Conjur on your local machine.
