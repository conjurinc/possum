---

The [Summon CLI tool](https://github.com/cyberark/summon) provides an interface
for fetching secrets from a provider and exporting them to a sub-process
environment. This prevents secrets from being exposed by removing the need to
store them directly in source code. Conjur provides convenient Summon
integrations for a number of different secret providers including AWS, Conjur,
and Chef.

See the [Summon GitHub repo](https://github.com/cyberark/summon) for
installation and usage instructions.  Additional information, including a list
of [secret providers](https://cyberark.github.io/summon/#providers) can be found
on the [Summon website](https://cyberark.github.io/summon).
