The [Conjur .NET API](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-api-dotnet) provides a
programmatic interface for talking to a Conjur server from within your .NET
project. You can use the .NET API to authenticate with Conjur, fetch secrets,
and grant access to hosts. Integration with Conjur provides a variety of
additional benefits including being able to store security policy as code, and automated secret rotation.
