{% include toc.md key='statement-reference' section='group' %}

A group of users and other groups. Layers can also be added to groups, in order to give applications the privileges of the group (such as access to secrets).

When a user becomes a member of a group they are granted the group role, and inherit the groupâ€™s privileges. Groups can also be members of groups; in this way, groups can be organized and nested in a hierarchy.
