In order not to delete our previous OIDC authenticator development which stopped in the middle due to change in priority,
We decide to mark this feature as shutdown.
In addition we want to use the same url of the authenticate API for this new feature which is also an OIDC authenticator,
But for different use case.

Feature: Users can authneticate with OIDC authenticator

  Background:
    Given a policy:
    """
    - !user alice

    - !policy
      id: conjur/authn-oidc/keycloak
      body:
      - !webservice
        annotations:
          description: Authentication service for Keycloak, based on Open ID Connect.

      - !variable
        id: client-id

      - !variable
        id: client-secret

      - !variable
        id: provider-uri

      - !variable
        id: id-token-user-property

      - !group users

      - !permit
        role: !group users
        privilege: [ read, authenticate ]
        resource: !webservice

    - !grant
      role: !group conjur/authn-oidc/keycloak/users
      member: !user alice
    """

    And I am the super-user
    And I successfully set OIDC variables


  Scenario: A valid authorization code and redirect uri to get Conjur access token
    Given I get authorization code
    When I successfully login via OIDC
    Then login response token is valid

    When I successfully authenticate via OIDC
    Then user "alice" is authorized
