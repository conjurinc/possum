## Create tokens [/host_factory_tokens]

### Create tokens [POST]

Creates one or more tokens which can be used to bootstrap host identity.
Responds with a JSON document containing the tokens and their restrictions.

If the tokens are created with a CIDR restriction, Conjur will only accept them
from the whitelisted IP ranges.

**Permissions required**

`execute` privilege on the Host Factory.

#### Example with `curl` and `jq`

Suppose your account is `mycorp`, your host factory is called `hf-db` and you
want to create two tokens, each of which which are usable only by local
addresses `127.0.0.1` and `127.0.0.2`, expiring at "2017-08-04T22:27:20+00:00".

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --data-urlencode "expiration=2017-08-04T22:27:20+00:00" \
     --data-urlencode "host_factory=mycorp:host_factory:hf-db" \
     --data-urlencode "count=2" \
     --data-urlencode "cidr[]=127.0.0.1" \
     --data-urlencode "cidr[]=127.0.0.2" \
     -H "$(conjur authn authenticate -H)" \
     https://eval.conjur.org/host_factory_tokens \
     | jq .
```

Note 1: `curl` will automatically encode your `POST` body if you use the
`--data-urlencode` option. If your HTTP/REST client doesn't support this
feature, you can [do it yourself][mdn-urlencode].

Note 2: in this example, the two provided addresses are logical OR-ed together
and apply to both tokens. If you wanted each token to have a *different* CIDR
restriction, you would make two API calls each with `count=1`.

## Create a host [/host_factories/hosts]

### Create a host [POST]

Creates a Host using the Host Factory and returns a JSON description of it.

Requires a Host Factory Token, which can be created using
the [create tokens][hf-tokens] API. In practice, this token is usually
provided automatically as part of Conjur integration with your host
provisioning infrastructure.

Note: if the token was created with a CIDR restriction, you must make this API
request from a whitelisted address.

[hf-tokens]: #host-factory-create-tokens-post
[puppet-integration]: https://forge.puppet.com/conjur/conjur

#### Example with `curl` and `jq`

Supposing that you have a Host Factory Token and want to create a new Host
called "brand-new-host":

```bash
token="1bcarsc2bqvsxt6cnd74xem8yf15gtma71vp23y315n0z201c1jza7"

curl --request POST --data-urlencode id=brand-new-host \
     --header "Authorization: Token token=\"$token\"" \
     https://eval.conjur.org/host_factories/hosts \
     | jq .
```

#### Request

**Headers**

A Host Factory Token must be provided as part of an HTTP
`Authorization` header. For example:

`Authorization: Token token=2c0vfj61pmah3efbgpcz2x9vzcy1ycskfkyqy0kgk1fv014880f4`

**Body Parameters**

  <code>string</code>
  (required)
  <span class="text-muted">
    <strong>Example:</strong> brand-new-host
  </span>

</dd>
<dt>annotations</dt>
<dd>
  <code>object</code>
