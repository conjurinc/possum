# Conjur Community Edition API

This is official documentation of the Conjur Community Edition API. It
allows you tremendous flexibility to control and manipulate your
Conjur software.

# User Authentication

Most API calls require an authentication access token. To obtain an access token as a user:

1. Use a username and password to obtain an API key (refresh token) with the [Authentication > Login](/#TODO) route.
2. Use the API key to obtain an access token with the [Authentication > Authenticate](/#TODO) route.

Access tokens expire after 8 minutes. You need to obtain a new token after it expires.
Token expiration and renewal is handled automatically by the
Conjur [CLI](https://developer.conjur.net/cli) and [client libraries](https://developer.conjur.net/clients).

## SSL verification

Use the public key you obtained when running `conjur init` for SSL verification when talking to your Conjur endpoint.
This is a *public* key, so you can check it into source control if needed.

For example, with curl:

```
$ curl --cacert <certfile> ...
```

## Authenticate [/api/authn/users/{login}/authenticate]

### Exchange a user login and API key for an access token [POST]

Conjur authentication is based on auto-expiring access tokens, which are issued by Conjur when presented with both:

* A login name
* A corresponding password or API key (aka 'refresh token')

The Conjur Access Token provides authentication for API calls.

For API usage, it is ordinarily passed as an HTTP Authorization "Token" header.

```
Authorization: Token token="eyJkYX...Rhb="
```

Before the access token can be used to make subsequent calls to the API, it must be formatted.
Take the response from the this call and base64-encode it, stripping out newlines.

```
token=$(echo -n $response | base64 | tr -d '\r\n')
```

The access token can now be used for Conjur API access.

```
curl --cacert <certfile> \
-H "Authorization: Token token=\"$token\"" \
<route>
```

NOTE: If you have the Conjur CLI installed you can get a pre-formatted access token with:

```
conjur authn authenticate -H
```

Properties of the access token include:

* It is JSON.
* It carries the login name and other data in a payload.
* It is signed by a private authentication key, and verified by a corresponding public key.
* It carries the signature of the public key for easy lookup in a public key database.
* It has a fixed life span of several minutes, after which it is no longer valid.
