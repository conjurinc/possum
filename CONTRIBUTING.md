If you want to help create Conjur (design, produce, QA, document,
code) then you are welcome. All roles are vital! :pray:

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Search open issues to find out what has already been addressed or planned
2. Open an issue in this repository to propose changes or fixes
3. Tag issue "in progress" as you work on it
4. Submit a pull request
5. Check the build status in Jenkins to ensure that the build succeeds & tests pass
6. Tag the issue "review", ask for a colleague to review and merge your code
7. Close the issue
