# Contributing to Conjur

If you want to help create Conjur (design, produce, QA, document,
code) then you are welcome. All roles are vital! :pray:

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Search the [open issues][waffle] in GitHub to find out what has been
   planned
2. Open an issue in this repository to propose changes or fixes
3. Tag issue "in progress" as you work on it
4. Run RSpec and Cucumber tests as described [here][tests], ensuring
   they pass
5. Submit a pull request
6. Tag the issue "review", ask another contributor to review and merge
   your code
7. Close the issue

Our [Waffle.io][waffle] is synchronized with GitHub and helps you
navigate this workflow more easily.
