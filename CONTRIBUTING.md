# Contributing to Conjur

Thanks for your interest in Conjur. If you'd like to help us create Conjur (design, produce, QA, document, code) then you are welcome. All roles are vital! :pray:

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Search the [open issues][waffle] in GitHub to find out what has been planned
2. Open an issue in this repository to propose changes or fixes
3. Tag issue "in progress" as you work on it
4. Run RSpec and Cucumber tests as described [here][tests], ensuring they pass
5. Submit a pull request
6. Tag the issue "review", ask another contributor to review and merge your code
7. Close the issue

Our [Waffle.io][waffle] is synchronized with GitHub and helps you navigate this workflow more easily.
