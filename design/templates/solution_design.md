## Background
[//]: # "Give relevant background for the designed feature. What is the motivation for this solution?"

## Issue description
[//]: # "Elaborate on the issue you are writing a solution for"

## Solution
[//]: # "Elaborate on the solution you are suggesting in this page. Address the functional requirements and the non functional requirements that this solution is addressing. If there are a few options considered for the solution, mention them and explain why the actual solution was chosen over them. Add an execution plan when relevant. It doesn't have to be a full breakdown of the feature, but just a recommendation to how the solution should be approached."

### Design
[//]: # "Add any diagrams, charts and explanations about the design aspect of the solution. Elaborate also about the expected user experience for the feature"

### Backwards compatibility
[//]: # "Address how you are going to handle backwards compatibility, if necessary"

### Performance
[//]: # "Elaborate on whether your solution will affect the product's performance, and how"

### Affected Components
[//]: # "Address the components that will be affected by your solution [Conjur, DAP, clients, integrations, etc.]"

### Cross-team dependencies
[//]: # "Elaborate about your solution's requirements or needs from other teams"

## Security
[//]: # "Are there any security issues with your solution? Even if you mentioned them somewhere in the doc it may be convenient for the security architect review to have them centralized here"

## Test Plan
[//]: # "Fill in the table below to depict the tests that should run to validate your solution"
[//]: # "You can use this tool to generate a table - https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables#"
