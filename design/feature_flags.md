# Feature Flags

Feature flags enable partially completed or experimental features to be
available in the official Conjur releases.
[Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html) has an
excellent article outlining various approaches to leveraging feature flags.

## Functional Overview

For our initial Feature Flag implementation only supports setting flags via
environment variables. In the future, we should support feature flags through
file-based as well.

### Define a new feature flag

To create a new feature flag, add the feature name to the `feature_flags` hash
in `config/initializers/feature_flags.rb`. Set the hash entry value to the
default state for the feature flag. For example, to create a feature flag
for a feature called `Telemetry Endpoint`, add the following:

```ruby
feature_flags = {
  telemetry_endpoint: false
}
```
and restart Conjur.

### Gate a feature

After a new flag has been added to the `feature_flags` hash, the Telemetry
Endpoint is now a valid feature flag. Functionality can be gated with the
following:

```ruby
if Rails.configuration.feature_flags.enabled?(:telemetry_endpoint)
  ... # Gated code here
end
```

### Enable a feature

To enable the Telemetry Endpoint feature, set the feature environment variable flag:

```sh
CONJUR_FEATURE_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT_ENABLED=true
```

and restart Conjur to pick up the new flag setting.
