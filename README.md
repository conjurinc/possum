Conjur provides secrets management and machine identity for modern infrastructure:

* **Machine Authorization Markup Language ("MAML")**, a role-based
  access policy language to define system components & their roles,
  privileges and metadata
* **A REST web service** to:
  * manage identity life cycles for humans and machines
  * organize and search roles and data in your secrets infrastructure
  * authorize access to resources using a sophisticated permission model
  * store secrets and make them available securely
* **Integrations** throughout the cloud toolchain:
  * infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
  * configuration management
  * continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)
  * container management and cloud orchestration

guide][contrib].

[contrib]: https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you should install some developer tools. These are not
required to deploy Conjur but they will let you develop using a standardized,
expertly configured environment.

1. [git][get-git] to manage source code
2. [Docker][get-docker] to manage dependencies and runtime environments
3. [Docker Compose][get-docker-compose] to orchestrate Docker environments

[get-docker]: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation
[get-git]: https://git-scm.com/downloads
[get-docker-compose]: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install

## Build Conjur as a Docker image

It's easy to get started with Conjur and Docker:

1. install dependencies (as above)
2. clone this repository
3. run the build script in your terminal:

   ```sh-session
   $ ./build.sh
   ...
   Successfully built 9a18a1396977
   $ docker images | grep conjur
   conjurinc/conjur latest a8229592474c 7 minutes ago 560.7 MB
   conjur           latest a8229592474c 7 minutes ago 560.7 MB
   conjur-dev       latest af98cb5b2a68 4 days ago    639.9 MB
   ```

## Set up a development environment

The `dev` directory contains a `docker-compose` file which creates a development
environment with a database container (`pg`, short for *postgres*), and a
`conjur` server container with source code mounted into the directory
`/src/conjur`.

To use it:

1. Install dependencies (as above)
2. Start the container (and optional extensions):

   ```sh-session
   $ cd dev
   $ ./start
   ...
   root@f39015718062:/src/conjur#
   ```

   Once the `start` script finishes, you're in a Bash shell in the Conjur
   server container.

   **LDAP Authentication**

   To use LDAP to authentication, run `start` with the `--authn-ldap` flag:

   ```sh-session
   $ cd dev
   $ ./start --authn-ldap
   ...
   root@f39015718062:/src/conjur#
   ```

   The `--authn-ldap` flag will:
  * Start an OpenLDAP container.
  * Load a user `alice` with the password `alice` into the LDAP server.
  * Load a policy `authn-ldap/test`, that grants `alice` the ability to authenticate via `http://localhost:3000/authn-ldap/test/cucumber/alice/authenticate` with the password `alice`.

3. Run the server

   ```sh-session
   root@f39015718062:/src/conjur# conjurctl server
   <various startup messages, then finally:>
   * Listening on tcp://localhost:3000
   Use Ctrl-C to stop
   ```

   The `conjurctl server` script performs the following:

   * wait for the database to be available
   * create and/or upgrade the database schema according to the `db/migrate`
     directory
   * find or create the token-signing key
   * start the web server

   If you are going to be debugging Conjur using `pry.byebug`, you may choose to
   start the web server by calling `rails server -b 0.0.0.0 webrick` instead of
   `conjurctl server`. This will allow you to work in the debugger without the
   server timing out.

4. Cleanup

    ```sh-session
    $ ./stop
    ```
    Running `stop` removes the running Docker Compose containers and the data key.

### Development CLI

As a developer, there are a number of common scenarios when actively working on Conjur.
The `./cli` script, located in the `dev` folder is intended to streamline these tasks.

```sh-session
$ ./cli --help

NAME
    cli - Developement tool to simplify working with a Conjur container.

SYNOPSIS
    cli [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

GLOBAL OPTIONS
    --help                                    - Show this message

COMMANDS

    exec                                      - Steps into the running Conjur container, into a bash shell.

    policy load <account> <policy/path.yml>   - Loads a conjur policy into the provided account.
```

#### Step into the running Conjur container

```sh-session
$ ./cli exec

root@88d43f7b3dfa:/src/conjur-server#
```


#### Load a policy

```sh-session
$ ./cli policy load <account> <policy/path/from/project/root.yml>
```

For most development work, the account will be `cucumber`, which is created when the developement environment starts. The policy path must be inside the `cyberark/conjur` project folder, and referenced from the project root.

## Testing

Conjur has `rspec` and `cucumber` tests.

### RSpec

RSpec tests are easy to run from within the `conjur` server container:

```sh-session
root@aa8bc35ba7f4:/src/conjur# rspec
Run options: exclude {:performance=>true}

Randomized with seed 62317
.............................................

Finished in 3.84 seconds (files took 3.33 seconds to load)
45 examples, 0 failures
```

### Cucumber

Cucumber tests require the Conjur server to be running. It's easiest to achieve
this by starting Conjur in one container and running Cucumber from another. Run
the service in the `conjur` server container:

```sh-session
root@aa8bc35ba7f4:/src/conjur# conjurctl server
...
* Listening on tcp://localhost:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

Then, using the `dev/cli` script, step into the Conjur container to run the cukes:

```sh-session
$ ./cli exec
...
root@9feae5e5e001:/src/conjur#
```

#### Run all the cukes:

There are three different cucumber suites: `api`, `policy`, and `authenticators`. Each of these can be run using a profile of the same name:

```sh-session
root@9feae5e5e001:/src/conjur# cucumber --profile api               # runs api cukes
root@9feae5e5e001:/src/conjur# cucumber --profile policy            # runs policy cukes
root@9feae5e5e001:/src/conjur# cucumber --profile authenticators    # runs authenticators cukes
```


#### Run just one feature:

```sh-session
root@9feae5e5e001:/src/conjur# cucumber --profile api cucumber/api/features/resource_list.feature
```

# Architecture

Conjur is designed to run in a Docker container(s), using Postgresql as the
backing data store. It's easy to run both Conjur and Postgresql in Docker; see
the `demo` directory for an example.

## Database

### DATABASE_URL environment variable

Conjur uses the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to connect to the database.
Typical options for this URL are:

* Local linked `pg` container
* External managed database such as AWS RDS.

## Database initialization

Conjur creates and/or updates the database schema automatically when it starts
up. Migration scripts are located in the `db/migrate` directory.

## Secrets and keys

Main article: [Conjur Cryptography](https://www.conjur.org/reference/cryptography.html)

Conjur uses industry-standard cryptography to protect your data.

Some operations require storage and management of encrypted data. For example:

* Roles can have associated API keys, which are stored encrypted in
  the database
* the `authenticate` function issues a signed JSON token; the signing key is a
  2048 bit RSA key which is stored encrypted in the database

Data is encrypted in and out of the database
using [Slosilo](https://github.com/conjurinc/slosilo), a library which provides:

* symmetric encryption using AES-256-GCM
* a Ruby class mixin for easy encryption of object attributes into the database
* asymmetric encryption and signing
* a keystore in a Postgresql database for easy storage and retrieval of keys

Slosilo has been verified by a professional cryptographic audit. Ask in our
Slack community for more details. (You can join [here][slack].)

### Important: avoid data loss

When you start Conjur, you must provide a Base64-encoded master data key in the
environment variable `CONJUR_DATA_KEY`. You can generate a data key using the
following command:

```
$ docker run --rm conjur data-key generate
```

Do NOT lose the data key, or all the encrypted data will be unrecoverable.

## Account management

Conjur supports the simultaneous operation of multiple separate accounts within
the same database. In other words, it's multi-tenant.

Each account (also called "organization account") has its own token-signing
private key. When a role is authenticated, the HMAC of the access token is
computed using the signing key of the role's account.

Accounts can be listed, created, and deleted via the `/accounts` service.
Permission to use this service is controlled by the built-in resource
`!:webservice:accounts`. Note that `!` is itself an organization account, and
therefore privileges on the `!:webservice:accounts` can be managed
via Conjur [policies](https://developer.conjur.net/policy).

# Versioning

Starting from version 0.1.0, this project follows
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Changelog maintenance

The [changelog file](CHANGELOG.md) is maintained based on
[Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) guidelines.

Each accepted change to the Conjur code (documentation and website updates
excepted) requires adding a changelog entry to the corresponding `Added`,
`Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed` and/or `Security` sub-section (add
one as necessary) of the _Unreleased_ section in the changelog.

Bumping the version number after each and every change is not required,
advised nor expected. Valid reasons to bump the version are for example:

- enough changes have accumulated,
- an important feature has been implemented,
- an external project depends on one of the recent changes.

## Cutting a release

- Examine the changelog and decide on the version bump rank (major, minor, patch).
- Change the title of _Unreleased_ section of the changelog to the target
version.
  - Be sure to add the date (ISO 8601 format) to the section header.
- Add a new, empty _Unreleased_ section to the changelog.
  - Remember to update the references at the bottom of the document.
- Change VERSION file to reflect the change. This file is used by some scripts.
- Commit these changes. `Bump version to x.y.z` is an acceptable commit message.
- Tag the version using eg. `git tag -s v0.1.1`. Note this requires you to be
  able to sign releases. Consult the
  [github documentation on signing commits](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg/)
  on how to set this up.
  - git will ask you to enter the tag message. These will become the release notes.
  Format should be like this (note the subject line and message):

        Version x.y.z

        This is a human-readable overview of the changes in x.y.z. It should be a
        consise, at-a-glance summary. It certainly isn't a direct copy-and-paste
        from the changelog.

- Push the tag: `git push vx.y.z` (or `git push origin vx.y.z` if you are working from your local machine).
- Create a pull request to have the release acked and merged.
  - https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/pull/new/vx.y.z

Deleting and changing tags should be avoided. If in any doubt if the release will
be accepted, before creating a tag push the (VERSION and CHANGELOG) changes in
a branch and ask for approval. Then create and push a tag on `master` once it's
been merged.
